//Your school has the following grading system based upon the marks(a) obtained by a student:
// If M≤10,the grade will be E
//If 11≥M≤20, the grade will be D.
//If 21≥M≤30, the grade will be C.
// If 31 ≥ a ≤ 40, the grade will be B.
// If 41 ≥ a ≤ 50, the grade will be A.
// Your friend will enter his marks out of 50, and your task is to print his grades using a switch statement
//Note: You have to complete findGrades function. No need to take any input.
